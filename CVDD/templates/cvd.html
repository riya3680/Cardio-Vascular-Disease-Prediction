            <h3>What is CardioVascular Disease?</h3>
            <p> Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels. They include: <ul>
              <li>Coronary heart disease – a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle;</li>
                <li>Cerebrovascular disease – a disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain;</li>
                <li>Peripheral arterial disease – a disease of blood vessels supplying the arms and legs;</li>
                <li>Rheumatic heart disease – damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria;</li>
                <li>Congenital heart disease – birth defects that affect the normal development and functioning of the heart caused by malformations of the heart structure from birth</li>
                <li>Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism – blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs.</li>
                </ul><br>
                Heart attacks and strokes are usually acute events and are mainly caused by a blockage that prevents blood from flowing to the heart or brain.
                The most common reason for this is a build-up of fatty deposits on the inner walls of the blood vessels that supply the heart or brain.
                Strokes can be caused by bleeding from a blood vessel in the brain or from blood clots.

            <h3>What are the symptoms of CardioVascular Disease?</h3>
            <p><b>Symptoms of heart attacks and strokes:</b> <br> Often, there are no symptoms of the underlying disease of the blood vessels. A heart attack or stroke may be the first sign of underlying disease. Symptoms of a heart attack include:<ul><li>pain or discomfort in the centre of the chest </li>
                <li>pain or discomfort in the arms, the left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back.</li> <br>In addition the person may experience difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath; nausea or vomiting; light-headedness or faintness; a cold sweat; and turning pale. Women are more likely than men to have shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain.<br>The most common symptom of a stroke is sudden weakness of the face, arm, or leg, most often on one side of the body. Other symptoms include sudden onset of:<ul><li>numbness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body;</li>
                <li> difficulty speaking or understanding speech;</li>
                <li>difficulty seeing with one or both eyes;</li>
                <li>difficulty walking, dizziness and/or loss of balance or coordination;</li>
                <li>severe headache with no known cause or fainting or unconsciousness.</li> <br>People experiencing these symptoms should seek medical care immediately</p>
