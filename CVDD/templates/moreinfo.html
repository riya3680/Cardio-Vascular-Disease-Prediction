            <ol>
                <li><b> Age</b> : Age of the patient in years is taken into consideration . </li>
                <li><b> Sex</b> : Gender of the patient is also considered.</li>
                <li><b> Chest Pain Type :</b> The four types of chest pain is checked for . They are - atypical angina ,typical angina, asymptomatic, non-anginal pain. <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b><i>Angina chest pain</i></b> is a pressure or squeezing like sensation that is usually caused when your heart muscle doesn't get an adequate supply of oxygenated blood.</li>
                        <li><b><i>Stable angina, also is known as typical angina or angina pectoris,</i></b>  is a symptom of myocardial ischemia. Stable angina is characterized by chest discomfort or anginal equivalent that is provoked with exertion and alleviated at rest or with nitroglycerin. </li>
                        <li><b><i>Silent (asymptomatic) myocardial ischemia (SMI)</i></b> is defined as a transient alteration in myocardial perfusion in the absence of chest pain or the usual anginal equivalents.</li>
                        <li><b><i>Nonanginal chest pain,</i></b> which doctors may also call noncardiac chest pain, refers to pain a person without heart disease may feel behind the breast bone. The pain may feel similar to angina, but it occurs due to different causes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> <b>Resting Blood Pressure (in mm Hg)</b> : When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.</li>
                <li> <b>Serum Cholesterol( in mg/dl )</b> : Cholesterol is a type of body fat, or lipid. A person's serum cholesterol level represents the amount of total cholesterol in their blood. A person's serum cholesterol level comprises the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides in the blood.</li>
                <li> <b>Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs):</b> The expected values for normal fasting blood glucose concentration are between 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L). When fasting blood glucose is between 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) changes in lifestyle and monitoring glycemia are recommended.</li>
                <li><b>Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)</b> : Resting 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is a non-invasive test that can detect abnormalities including arrhythmias, evidence of coronary heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy and bundle branch blocks.</li>
                <li><b>Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach):</b> Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.</li>
                <li><b>Exercise Induced Angina (exang): </b> pain in the chest that comes on with exercise, stress, or other things that make the heart work harder. It is an extremely common symptom of coronary artery disease, which is caused by cholesterol-clogged coronary arteries.</li>
                <li><b>ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak):</b> Exercise induced ST segment depression is considered a reliable ECG finding for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis. It has also been associated with a worse prognosis for patients with a documented coronary artery disease (CAD).</li>
                <li><b>Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope):</b> The ST segment shift relative to exercise-induced increments in heart rate, the ST/heart rate slope (ST/HR slope), has been proposed as a more accurate ECG criterion for diagnosing significant coronary artery disease, (1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping).</li>
                <li><b>Number of Major Vessels Colored by Flouroscopy (ca):</b> displays the value as integer or float.fluoroscopy is used as an adjunct to enable the doctor to see the flow of blood through the coronary arteries in order to evaluate the presence of arterial blockages.</li>
                <li><b>Thalassemia (thal):</b> displays the thalassemia(Thalassemia (inherited blood disorder that causes your body to have less hemoglobin than normal.)
                    3 = normal
                    6 = fixed defect
                    7 = reversible defect
                </li>
